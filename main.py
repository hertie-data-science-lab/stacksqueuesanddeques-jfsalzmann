# PLEASE NOTE
# We noticed that the commands given in the main.py initially
# did not at all match the interface definition of the AQM class
# as provided at Github. Additionally, some methods used here were
# not defined in the task on Github. We handled the situation as
# follows: We followed the names and basic instructions on Github,
# and added the missing methods according to the main.py.
# As stated in the class, we relied on not having to implement
# the AQM with Arrays, so we have a dynamic length list underlying
# with no need to have length adjustment, or use a front pointer.
